    <h1>The Dark Web Needs Us – My Tor Middle Relay</h1>
    <p>I set up a Tor middle relay on my Raspberry Pi 4 Model B to support the Tor network. This relay doesn't connect users directly to websites (like an exit node), and it doesn’t initiate connections (like a guard node). Instead, it simply passes encrypted traffic between other relays in the network.</p>
    <p>Middle relays are important because they help handle traffic load and improve the speed and reliability of the Tor network. They don’t log any personal data and can’t see where the traffic is coming from or going to—they just forward encrypted packets.</p>
    <p>My relay runs continuously in the background and contributes bandwidth to strengthen the overall Tor ecosystem. It’s low maintenance, safe to run, and helps support privacy-focused communication around the world.</p>
